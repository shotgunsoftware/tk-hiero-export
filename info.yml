                     is the Hiero Source to get the thumbnail from. The third
                     argument is the Hiero TrackItem that the source was pulled

                     create.

                     The return value is a data dictionary for the shot, whose
                     id will be updated.  Cut information will be merged into this
                     dictionary before Shotgun update is called on the shot.
                     The default implementation creates or looks up a sequence
